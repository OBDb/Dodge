## About Dodge

Dodge is an American automobile brand and division of Stellantis (formerly part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles). Founded by brothers Horace and John Dodge in 1914, the brand has a rich history spanning over a century of automotive innovation and performance vehicles.

## Generations

- **Early Years (1914-1928)**: Dodge was established as a standalone company by the Dodge brothers, quickly building a reputation for durable and reliable vehicles. Their first car was the Dodge Model 30, positioned as a slightly upscale alternative to Ford's Model T. After the deaths of both founders in 1920, the company was sold to investment bankers before being acquired by Chrysler Corporation in 1928.

- **Chrysler Era (1928-1998)**: Under Chrysler's ownership, Dodge became known for innovative engineering and design. During World War II, Dodge produced military vehicles and equipment. In the post-war era, Dodge established itself in the American market with models like the Power Wagon, Dart, Charger, and Challenger. The 1960s and 1970s marked Dodge's golden age of muscle cars, when the brand produced iconic vehicles that defined American performance.

- **DaimlerChrysler & Cerberus Period (1998-2009)**: Following Chrysler's merger with Daimler-Benz in 1998, Dodge underwent significant changes. The brand expanded its lineup with the introduction of the Durango SUV and the revival of the Charger nameplate as a four-door sedan. After Daimler sold Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management in 2007, Dodge faced challenges during the global financial crisis.

- **Fiat Chrysler Era (2009-2021)**: Under Fiat's control after Chrysler's bankruptcy reorganization, Dodge was repositioned as a performance brand. The brand phased out several mainstream models, focusing instead on high-performance vehicles like the Challenger and Charger with their SRT and Hellcat variants. During this period, Dodge became synonymous with powerful V8 engines and American muscle.

- **Stellantis Era (2021-present)**: Following the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group to form Stellantis, Dodge has begun transitioning toward electrification while maintaining its performance heritage. The brand has announced plans for electric muscle cars and performance-oriented EVs, marking a new chapter in Dodge's evolution while honoring its performance legacy.
